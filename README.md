## K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm from scratch using Python 
K nearest neighbor is a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. For this project, I've implemented KNN from scratch using python, without relying on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or pytorch. The goal of the program is to predict a person's height based on his/her age, weight and gender. I've embedded the training dataset directly into the code. It mainly consists of data belonging to popular kpop idols.
